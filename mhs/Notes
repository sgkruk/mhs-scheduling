To create project: 
   django-admin startproject PROJECTNAME

To start the dev server (lightweight server for dev ONLY)
   cd mhsweb/
   python manage.py runserver 8080

Setup the database engine in settings.py
CAREFUL: The names in there of sqlite.db and templates are ABSOLUTE.
This makes it very hard to move from a Mac to my Desktop.

Need a database and user, at least.
Then 
	 python manage.py syncdb

To create an app (application, part of a larger project)
   python manage.py startapp APPNAME


To change the model (i.e. the database schema)
   edit models.py
   Ensure the settings.py fila has PROJECTNAME.APPNAME in the apps
   Then 
   python manage.py reset APPNAME (to delete the database)
   python manage.py syncdb
   
To get the admin generator
   Uncomment the two lines at the top or urls.py
   python manage.py syncdb

To get one specific model to be handled by the admin
   create a file admin.py in the APPNAME directory
   It includes
from PROJECTNAME.APPNAME.models import MODELNAME
from django.contrib import admin

admin.site.register(MODELNAME)

An experiment in developing a front-end in Django with a backend in ECLiPSe-CLP.  The front-end allows the staff to define the parameters of a schedule (days open/close, at what time open/close, how many staff at start, at end, etc...)

The backend is a constraint program to find the best schedule satisfying all the criteria where best is defined as best for the staff.

If all goes well here, we will then abstract process to construct a general scheduler.

At first glance we have two types, _requests_ and _resources_.  A _request_ is a set of constraints relating resources attributes and time intervals.  A resource is an element with a specific set of attributes and time availabilities.

For example, a request is "Need 3 managers Monday from 9 to 12".  A resource is "Paul Edouard, Manager, 10 years seniority, available M-F 0900h-1600h".
